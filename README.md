# Data structures & algorithms(Struct-Algo)

A repository where I will upload implementations of various data structures and algorithms as I learn them.
The implementations may vary in language, some examples will be in C while others in C++, Python or others.

## Contents

The documentation is split in two parts:

- [Data structures](#data-structures)
- [Algorithms](#algorithms)
